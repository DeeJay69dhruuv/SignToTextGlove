# SignToTextGlove
A glove which converts certain precoded signs to speech using flex sensors, and esp32 module.
A specific wiring system is used to connect esp32 with the flex sensors.
The bends in flex sensors changes the resistance of the flex sensor and causes the current values to change
This is measure across the esp32. 
This change is value is then accounted and graphs are plotted for the same.
